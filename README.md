## Description

The main objective of this project is to gain a thorough understanding of the underlying structure of e-commerce platforms. This application was developed as a back end for an e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies and allows the user to compete with other e-commerce businesses, with the manager of an online retail company as the target user. This e-commerce application uses object-relational mapping (ORM) and has a modified back end starter code. Additionally, its working Express.js API is configured to use Sequelize as the WORM that interacts with the MySQL database, which consists of tables for categories, products, tags, and product tags. RESTful API routes point to each standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operation to make requests on the database.

## Installation

#### How to install the application:

- First, clone the git repository from GitHub

- Next, install the required packages by using the following command: npm install

- Then, invoke the application by using the following command: npm start

- Finally, the user will have access to the Employee Tracker's database of departments, roles, and employees.

## Usage

#### How to use the application:

- First, install the given application/project

- Next, the command-line application will prompt the user with the following: `view all departments`, `view all roles`, `view all employees`, `add a department`, `add a role`, `add an employee` & `update an employee role`.

- Then, if the user selects: `view all departments`, `view all roles`, or `view all employees`, then they are presented with a table displaying the given data.

- Then, if the user selects: `add a department`, `add a role`, or `add an employee`, then they are able to create a new index for the given data.

- Then, if the user selects: `update an employee role`, then they are able to update the given data.

- Finally, if the user selects: `delete departments, roles, and employees`, then they are able to delete by department, a role, or an employee.
